How big is it? Slightly smaller than normal pillbugs.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Herbivore.
Where does it live? Crystal Caverns.
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Strong chitin. Gives some crystal resource when butchered? Quite durable and rolls up when harmed, making it far more durable.
